This Machine Learning Project is based on Prediction of Used Cars in USA from Craigslist
The dataset was collected from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data



### Project Overview

1. Data Input Section: 
Fields for entering information about the used car, such as the year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel type, odometer reading, title status, transmission type, drive type, vehicle type, paint color, county, and state. 
2. Pre-processing Module: 
Utilize Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data cleaning and preparation tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. 
3. Data visualization(Exploratory Data analysis) : 
Using the above cleaned data , for creating visualizations , such as heat maps, box plots etc, for finding correlation among variables,and outlier detection, respectively. 
Using other kinds of visualizations to find patterns and relationships among average . 
4. Model Selection: 
Select from different regression algorithms for predicting the car price, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression. 
Evaluate each algorithm's performance and suitability for the project. 
Using multiple models and trying to use model stacking to find our predicted variable. 
5. Model Training Section: 
Button to initiate the training process with the selected algorithm. 
Progress indicator to track the training progress. 
Feedback on the success or failure of the training process, including any errors encountered during training. 
6. Prediction Output: 
Display the predicted price of the used car based on the trained regression model. 
Provide insights into the factors influencing the predicted price, such as feature importance or coefficients. 
Visual representation of the predicted price compared to actual prices for similar cars, such as a scatter plot or histogram. 
7. Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared value. 
Compare the performance of different regression algorithms used in the model selection stage. 
8. Improvement and Iteration: 
Identify areas for improving the model's accuracy based on evaluation results and user feedback. 
Implement updates or adjustments to the model and retrain as necessary to enhance predictive capabilities.
